        <br />
        <li>
          Css described how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, or in
          other media.

      <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
      <ul class="ul1">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elemeentsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>
          External - by using link elements to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
          files. However,<mark>
            in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,
          </mark>
          because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
          yourself.

      </ul>
      <p class="p">
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSSclass applies
        a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand, applies a style to
        one unique elements.IDis also special in that you can use a special URL
        to link directiy to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or
        set of style ir styles can be applied to the element.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly
        used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style
        should be applied.
